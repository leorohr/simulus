Attendees: Alan, Jerry, Ebriham, Leonhard, Paul

\section {Topics covered}
\begin{itemize}
\item  Discussion on the next step approach on simulation.
\item  Decision on choosing discrete time and continuous space(currently discrete space) on a microscopic model.  
\item Reason: Discrete space involves jumping positions from one to another - the behaviour of the car could be very difficult to model on a map where cars will compete for space(visual presentation would be discredited), whereas continuous space allows car to travel smoothly on the map. 

\item Conducted 2 trails of presentation 

\end{itemize}
