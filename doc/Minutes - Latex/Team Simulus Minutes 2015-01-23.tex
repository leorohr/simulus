\begin{itemize}
\item          1: Construct a Base codes that covers a simple model of structure i.e. Single lane, single intersection  \item          2. Initial design should include Double Lanes for each side of the road\item          3. Map model based on XML/JSON inputs (Justification required) \item         4. Initial design should include the modelling One Object of car  \item          5. JavaFX (justification) \item         6. Entrance and Exit of the vehicles - assigned them to the edges of the map  \item        7. Object behaviour: Normal forward speed    \item       8. Optional work: Considering an extra lane for emergency use\item          9. Traffic Volume: Tick boxes for different behaviours, i.e. politeness, rush hour  \item         10. Default behaviour?   \item        11. Tick behaviour: use the middle line marker to moderate the change of behaviour, i.e. Merging 2 lines into 1 line
