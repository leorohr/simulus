\section{Requirements \& Design}\label{sec:reqs}
Having looked at the differences in typical traffic simulation models, we can confidently develop a specification for the requirements of our software. In this section, we highlight these requirements and the design choices we made to meet them.

A dynamic systems development environment may benefit greatly from a hierarchical ordering of aims expressing a priority scheme for the group to follow. In order to actualise this structuring, we followed the MoSCoW scheme~\cite{brennan2009} to assign the project's goals to the following four priority classes based on the research:
\begin{enumerate} \itemsep1pt \parskip0pt \parsep0pt
	\item{Must have}
		\begin{enumerate} \itemsep1pt \parskip0pt \parsep0pt
			\item{Individual Vehicle Simulation}
			\item{Vehicle Entrance \& Exit}
			\item{Diverse Vehicle Behaviours}
			\item{Statistics}
			\item{Traffic Management Policies}
		\end{enumerate}
	\item{Should have}
		\begin{enumerate} \itemsep1pt \parskip0pt \parsep0pt
			\item{Emergency Services}
			\item{User-defined Maps}
		\end{enumerate}
	\item{Could have}
		\begin{enumerate} \itemsep1pt \parskip0pt \parsep0pt
			\item{Import/Export of Maps and Settings}
			\item{External Map Source, e.g. Google Maps}
		\end{enumerate}
	\item{Won't have}
		\begin{enumerate} \itemsep1pt \parskip0pt \parsep0pt
			\item{Pre-exisiting Traffic Simulators or Third-Party Libraries}
		\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

The requirements classified under the heading "must have" depict the features that must be implemented for the simulation to function at a basic level. The elements contained within the next level of classification are of a high importance, but may be omitted if resource or time constraints appear. "Could have" is indicative of features that provide the system with greater functionality, but the timeliness of their implementation is not critical. The final requirements partition is related to those features that our simulation will not exhibit under any circumstances \cite{d2014introduction}. 

The software deliverable is split up into a map editor application and a simulator application. We will explain the design of and the requirements put on the simulator before introducing the map editing functionality in~\ref{ss:req-editor}.

\subsection{Simulator}
\subsubsection{Design}
\label{subsec:design}
After selecting a microscopic approach to traffic simulation, we began to develop a functioning prototype to meet the basic requirements of the system. Our first development prototype was built upon a discrete time and space model. This model is based around a central clock which dictates the time intervals that the map should update all vehicle positions. Discrete space is in reference to the notion that cars move through the map tiles whilst being fixated into those tiles (cellular automata). We used a 40x40 tiles map to demonstrate the functionality of the prototype. Simulating traffic in this way has brought about an ease in development whilst inhibiting the potential capabilities of the simulation.

The structure of the prototype means that it is reliant on a central clock for the computation of all cars moving one or more full tiles per step. This tile-by-tile movement does not allow for the simulation of basic attributes of vehicles, such as acceleration, and makes it very difficult to design cars with different speeds. In other words, while a discrete space model eases the overall implementation; effectively allowing us to achieve quick results, it also imposes restrictions in terms of the simulation's flexibility.

After analysing the impact of these restrictions, we then opted for a combination of a discrete time with continuous space model. That is, we kept the central clocking mechanism of the simulation, but cars can move through the network on a pixel-by-pixel instead of tile-by-tile basis. The underlying map is still tile-based however, allowing for an easy framework in the design of new maps using the editor as well as an effective method of cellular automata based collision avoidance. 

\subsubsection*{Road Network Design}

All roads in our model contain four lanes - two in each direction. A road that lies directly at the border of the map will function as an entry point to the network, i.e. a point where vehicles can enter (and leave) the road system. Intersections contain predefined paths and allow turning left and right from any of the lanes leading into an intersection. As a vehicle approaches an intersection, it will choose one of these paths randomly and follow it through the intersection. The traffic flow is governed by the use of traffic lights. Each intersection has four sets of lights, one for each pair of lanes. As long as north- and southbound lanes have a green signal, east- and westbound lanes will have a red light and vice versa. The light phase duration begins at a randomly selected value within a range from 3 to 6 seconds and allows user-defined values. Red phases of orthogonal lanes overlap by 1750 milliseconds in order to allow vehicles to clear the junction. Lanes can be blocked arbitrarily, simulating lane closures or obstacles on the road.

\subsubsection*{Intersections and Paths}
In order to properly simulate the real world, paths on an intersection should be adapted according to the structure of lanes around the intersection itself. This gives the user the freedom of creating any formation of lanes around an intersection (e.g. t-junctions) and have vehicles still follow a valid path. With this consideration in mind, we designed the \textit{CustomPath} class with an attribute that allowed it to be either active or inactive. These could then be set based on whether or not that path is valid in the context of a created map. Furthermore, the active paths could be switched dynamically to avoid unrealistic collisions in an intersection whilst giving more flexibility in the amount of paths a vehicle can take. These variables are all computed in the initialisation of the map as well as periodically as traffic lights are switched. It follows that a vehicle will only move along a path that is active.



\subsubsection*{Collision Avoidance Strategy}

Our collision avoidance policy is based on tiles being either occupied or unoccupied. As a vehicle moves through the map, it will always occupy the tiles it currently intersects. With every simulation step, each vehicle checks the tile ahead of it, and will progress iff the tile is unoccupied. If a car is blocked by a vehicle in front of it, it will also check tiles further ahead and to the sides and, if the tiles are free, the blocked car will attempt to overtake based on its set behaviour. If the tile in front is occupied due to an obstacle other than a vehicle, a car will pass it whenever the adjacent lane is free.

The proposed simulator allows the simulation of different types of vehicles. We differentiate between cars, trucks and emergency vehicles. To translate the metrics of the different vehicle movements we employed the following unit conversions. One simulation step is set to simulate $\frac{1}{10}$ of a real-time second. Each tile on the map depicts a 5m by 5m square. Given these measurements, a desired acceleration $a_r$ in $m/s^2$ and the edge length of a tile $l_t$ in pixel we can specify the acceleration of vehicles in $pixel/step$ as follows:
	\begin{equation}\label{for:acceleration}	
		a_s = \frac{a_r * l_t}{5 * 10}
	\end{equation}
	To translate the speed $v_s$ from simulation-specific to real-world units, i.e. from $pixel/step$ to $km/h$, we using the following conversion:
	\begin{equation}\label{for:speed}
		v_r = v_s * \frac{50}{l_t} 
	\end{equation}
	
Given these representations, we set a car's acceleration to $2.32m/s^2$, corresponding to a 0-100$km/h$ acceleration in 12 seconds. Trucks are set to accelerate with $0.5m/s^2$, that is from 0 to 80$km/h$ in approximately 45 seconds. Emergency vehicles exhibit 	one and a half times the acceleration of a normal car, i.e. $3.48m/s^2$ or from 0 to 100$km/h$ in roughly 9 seconds. All vehicles will accelerate as long as their speed is lower than their personal maximum speed. This speed is set to an arbitrary speed between 10$km/h$ and the maximum allowed speed in the simulation, which can be set to a value ranging from 10 to 130$km/h$ by the user.

\subsubsection*{Implementation Design}
	
After describing the aforementioned model, we must now introduce the design of the implementation. The software is based on the JavaFX UI framework. We decided for a Model-View-Controller architecture, not only because it is the natural design of JavaFX applications, but most importantly because it allowed us to split development tasks concisely into model and view development work packages, which can be tackled independently from each other and are then brought together by the controller package. Unfortunately, we were not able to keep the strict division of model and view code throughout the entire development phase. We elaborate further on this issue in section~\ref{ss:eval_sim}. 

\begin{figure}[t]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/package_diagram.pdf}
		\caption[Snippet of the Package Diagram]{Snippet of the Package Diagram}
		\label{fig:packages}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:packages} shows an excerpt of the overall structure of the codebase. The package on the highest level of the hierarchy, \textit{com.simulus}, contains two subordinate packages besides three classes of itself. These three classes form the JavaFX application (and they all extend the JavaFX base class \textit{Application}). When the software suite is started, the \textit{Startup} class will present a splash screen that allows the user to choose between the simulator (\textit{MainApp}) and the map editor application (\textit{EditorApp}).

The \textit{controller} package contains classes that do what its name insinuates. The \textit{SimulationController} is responsible for the supervision of the running simulation and the modification of the simulation's parameters.  It also contains the definition of the \textit{AnimationThread} (Fig.~\ref{fig:animthread}) and manages said thread's lifecycle. The \textit{ControlsController} is the JavaFX controller class associated with the simulation parameter controls and the statistics on the right panel in the simulator application. 

The \textit{view} package contains three more subpackages and two classes on its own. The \textit{Tile} class forms the base for all the different types of tiles in the simulator, that includes land tiles, which simply add a texture and realistic appearance to the road network. A \textit{TileGroup} is an interface which represents a collection of tiles, and is implemented by both \textit{Road} and \textit{Intersection}.  The three shown classes in the \textit{map} package are used to depict the map itself and the road network on it. \textit{Lane} objects are extensions of tiles. Each lane has a direction (north, south, east or west) and can be blocked or occupied by a vehicle. A \textit{Road} contains four lanes, either two north- and two southbound or two east- and two westbound lanes. The third class in the package, the \textit{Map}, is the actual representation of the road network. It contains the tile grid and exposes functionality to operate on this grid, e.g. calculating the average congestion of the network. Furthermore the map holds lists of all vehicles and traffic lights. \textit{Intersection}s are tilegroups as well, composed of \textit{IntersectionTiles}. These special tiles for intersections contain \textit{CustomPath}s, which allow for the above mentioned turning on intersections and are an extension to the JavaFX \textit{Path} class. They provide methods to check whether the path is free and whether the path should be available at all. A path can be unavailable if the intersection is not a four-way junction but for example a T-junction.  

In the \textit{vehicle} package we encapsulate the different kinds of vehicles the simulator supports. The abstract class \textit{Vehicle} provides the basic functionality, i.e. accelerating, moving, avoiding obstacles and alike. \textit{Truck}s, \textit{Car}s and \textit{EmergencyCar}s then extend this class with specific behaviours and attributes. Designing the package in this way will effectively allow the easy introduction of additional types of vehicle.

\subsubsection{Requirements}
Requirement (1a), the simulation of individual vehicles, means that the simulation has to evaluate the behaviour of each car individually and draw conclusions for the traffic systems based on these observations. In simulation terms, we derive macroscopic statistics of a traffic network based on the aggregation of microscopic data.

\begin{wrapfigure}{t}{0.3\textwidth}
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{img/graphs.png}
		\caption[Simulation Statistics at Runtime]{Simulation Statistics at Runtime}
		\label{fig:graphs}
	\end{center}
\end{wrapfigure}

During the simulation, vehicles enter the traffic network at one point, make their way through it, and exit it at an arbitrary touching-point of a road and the border of the map. (1b) On their way through the network, they exhibit different driving behaviours (1c), namely cautious, reckless and semi. Cautious drivers do not overtake and adjust their speed to surrounding cars while reckless drivers want to maximise their speed and overtake whenever possible. The third possible behaviour is called "semi". A car with this behavioural setting will change from cautious to reckless driving from time to time.

\subsubsection*{Real-time Statistical Data}

The observations of the traffic network mentioned above are captured in live statistics at runtime of the simulation (1d).  We provide four charts measuring different network statistics (Fig.~\ref{fig:graphs}). The first metric is the number of cars currently in the system, which gives a good reference point when analysing the trend of the other metrics. Secondly, we show the average speed of all present vehicles. The speed is given in km/h (cf. formula~\ref{for:speed} for the unit conversion) and presented as arithmetic mean. The third chart displayed shows the current congestion in the traffic network. Congestion is defined as the fraction of currently occupied tiles and the total number of tiles: $\frac{|\:\lbrace \:t\:|\:t\:\epsilon\:T\:\wedge\:t\:is\:occupied\rbrace\:|}{|\:T\:|}$, $T$ being the set of tiles. The last chart depicts two data series. First, the average time a normal vehicle had to wait on its way through the map (orange) and as a second line the average waiting time of an emergency vehicle (yellow). This chart nicely illustrates how the the fact that surrounding vehicles give way for emergency vehicles reduces their idle time in the traffic network. The displayed time is translated from simulation time into real time (i.e. multiplied by factor 10). The average is again shown as the arithmetic mean as follows: $10*n^{-1}\sum\limits_{i=1}^n w_i$, $w_i$ being the amount of simulation ticks vehicle $i$ has been idle. For improved readability, the statistics can be popped out of the user interface into a separate, resizable window (see button in top bar in Fig.~\ref{fig:graphs}). Additionally, the suite allows the export of the current simulation session's statistics into the comma-separated-value format for further analysis.

\subsubsection*{Traffic Management Policies}

When simulating the flow of cars in a traffic network, it is of utmost importance to be able to alter the traffic management policies that are brought into effect (requirement 1e). Traffic management policies that are tangible in real-life situations include speed limits and the duration of red-light-phases of traffic lights. Besides these two, the Simulus simulation suite allows adjustment of the following simulation-specific policies: the maximum number of cars in the network, the tickrate of the simulation in milliseconds, the spawn delay, i.e. after how many ticks a new vehicle appears on the map, the ratio of cars to trucks (a value of 1 restricts trucks from spawning, 0 analogous stops cars from spawning), and lastly the ratio of reckless drivers to cautious drivers. All of the aforementioned but the traffic light duration are adjustable via sliders on the right side of the interface. The traffic light duration can be randomised for all traffic lights at once via a button, assigning a phase duration between 3 and 6 seconds. To improve the accuracy of the simulation, the phase duration of individual traffic lights can be user-defined.

\subsubsection*{Emergent Phenomena Support}

The requirements discussed above comprised the \textit{Must have} category of our goals. The next requirement to mention is the implementation of emergency services (2a). In \cite{helbing2013agent}, Helbing explains that the realism of a simulation is largely dependant on its ability to deal with emergent phenomena. It follows that emergency vehicles enjoy priority privileges in our simulation in a similar way to real life. In order to simulate the special attention that other drivers pay to approaching emergency vehicles, we introduce an "Area of Effect". This area, implemented as a circle, surrounds the moving ambulance that will cause vehicles surrounding the ambulance to exhibit special behaviours. Specifically, any normal vehicle that intersects said circle will slow down to 10km/h and merge to an adjacent lane if it is in the same lane with the ambulance. If the vehicle intersects the area of effect but is currently in a lane adjacent to the ambulance it will slow down and keep a 3 tile (i.e. 15m) distance to cars in the front in order to allow other cars to merge into its lane. Emergency vehicles ignore red lights whenever the intersection is clear.
\\\\
Why and how we accommodate user-defined maps (2b) will be discussed in length in section ~\ref{ss:req-editor} below. The import and export of maps and settings (3a) is an optional requirement. We envisioned allowing users to define maps and store them in XML files to reuse or share them. Similarly, exporting and importing the simulation settings and policies used in a simulation session would allow recreating the exact session at a later point in time. Using external map sources to create maps, e.g. base a map on the the Google Maps representation online, enables users to simulate real-life traffic networks without the necessity of recreating them.

The last mentioned requirement, is stating what the software will not contain: reused code or third-party libraries. We aim to design and implement vehicle behaviours and the logic of the simulation on our own and not rely on external libraries. This is justified by the opportunity to study the domain of traffic simulation and not outsource the complexities to pre-existing implementations and libraries.

\subsection{Editor}\label{ss:req-editor}
According to 2(b) and 3(a) of the MoSCoW analysis, our system 'would' include the ability to design, construct and save maps for use with our simulator.  This would then give the ability to test different traffic networks, the affect variable conditions would yield on traffic flow and, more importantly, the strengths and weakness of the simulation engine itself. Below we list the high-level functional requirements for our map editor.

\subsection{Data Storage \& Retrieval}\label{ss:xml}
Fundamental to the interaction between the \textit{Simulator} and \textit{Map Editor} was the common data exchange that would be necessary for storing a map.

The first challenge was agreeing on a schema that was sufficient in representing the attributes of a map.  This would have to be based on the requirements, both visual and functional, of the simulator and the editor.  The identified list is shown in table\ref{ref:mapTable}. 

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|l|}
	\hline
	\textbf{Category} & \textbf{Attribute} \\ \hline
	metadata & name, date, author, description \\ \hline
	specification & canvas\textunderscore size, number\textunderscore of\textunderscore tiles, validated \\ \hline
	grid & x, y, type, subType, direction, laneNo, isBlock \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Finalised Map Schema}
\label{ref:mapTable}
\end{table}

\paragraph{}
The attributes in the \textit{metadata} category are purely for differentiating the map file and providing some useful information to the user. Those in the \textit{specification} are indeed important to functionality; although the canvas size is fixed, the grid size is not. For this reason, \textit{number\textunderscore of\textunderscore tiles} is used to indicate a grid size of 40, 60 or 80. The attributes in \textit{grid} are used for the representation of the dynamic grid.  A superset of all attributes necessary for tagging individual tiles and thus representing a map is defined in the \textit{grid} category.

In addition to storing a map, we felt that the retrieval of simulation parameters for reuse and the exporting of analytic information captured was necessary.  The ability to import and export simulation parameters is defined in a similar manner to that of a map but the exporting of simulation analytics is carried out through a Comma Separated Value (CSV) file so that it may be loaded directly into a suitable application for further analysis.

\subsubsection{Format}
Our focus turns to compliant formats for physical storage.  In the realm of lightweight mapping, XML and JSON are forerunners for text-based file formats.  Both are heavily used, JSON however, being the newer option, is arguably preferred for JavaScript web based applications.  XML is more wide-spread and is thus adopted by mapping providers, with many formats now based on XML e.g. GML, KML, etc.
 
We gave consideration to each during requirements elicitation and, coupled with the properties of both file formats, came to a decision.  The XML format was chosen for its suitable mark-up of data definition and while more verbose in structure than JSON, was more suitable to our needs.  It has been shown that the additional tags may have a slight overhead associated with them \cite{codeproject2013}, however as there is no data transmission involved in our system, this was not a concern.  For our simple needs, either option would have ultimately been an acceptable choice but the team's familiarity and previous experience with XML made it the preferred option.  XML was also selected for the storage of the simulation parameters while the exporting of analytic data was in the form of CSV. 

The code snippet in listing~\ref{code:xmlsnippet} depicts the basic format of an XML designed to be generated by the editor after a map is created. The underlying idea is that these XML files can be translated into a multidimensional array of tiles that the simulation can use to reconstruct the map. Each tile in the XML file holds information about the attributes of each tile on the map.
