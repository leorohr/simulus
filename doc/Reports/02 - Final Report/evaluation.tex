\section{Evaluation}
\subsection{Simulator}
* features we planned: implemented vs not implemented? refer to requirements list in section~\ref{sec:reqs}
* the change from discrete to continuous was result of improved thinking, while changes X, Y and Z were force upon us. 
* performance issues with greater number of cars (> 70)
* refactoring? probably improve perf. by decluttering vehicle-methods (quote cycl. complexity)
** a lot of instanceof checking which could probably have been avoided by more concise oo-design
